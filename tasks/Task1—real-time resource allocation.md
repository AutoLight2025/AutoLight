**Task Description**

This task emulates the computational service deployment in data center interconnection (DCI).

The demand matrices for computing resources are generated from the orchestrator. Subsequently, resource allocations corresponding to these demand matrices are implemented, specifically performing routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) at the physical layer and establishing routing policies at the network layer. The system then evaluates whether the performance metrics exceed predetermined thresholds.

**Checkpoints Defination**

Checkpoint-1: Demand matrixes generated.<br>
Checkpoint-2: Network routing completed.<br>
Checkpoint-3: Performance metrics are compared with thresholds.<br>

**Scoring Criteria for Task Completion Rates**

| Event | Completion rate |
| :----: | :----: |
| Demand matrixes generated | 25% |
| Physical layer RWA completed | 50% |
| Network routing completed| 75% |
| Performance metrics are compared with thresholds | 100% |
